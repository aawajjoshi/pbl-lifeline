        <h1 class=about-heading>Our History</h1>
        <p>
            In 1983 Bonnie Williams, daughter of respected Maryville resident Inez Bowman, told her mother about an
            emergency response system that was available in Iowa City, IA. She thought her mother might be interested in
            the
            program. Inez was intrigued by the concept and brought it to the Maryville Citizens for Community Action
            (MCCA)
            for consideration. The MCCA Human Resources Task Force thought it warranted further investigation and
            approached
            St. Francis Hospital to see if they would be interested in establishing the program. The Hospital had
            already
            heard of the program and they were considering it.
        </p>
        <p>

            A committee, consisting of Martin Goedken from St. Francis Hospital, Mildred Davis, Inez Bowman and Donna
            Holt
            traveled to St. Joseph, MO to talk to the Lifeline volunteer coordinator to see how their organization
            operated.
            After this meeting the St. Francis Hospital administration decided that the funds were not available to buy
            the
            units necessary to begin the program. Undaunted, a group of individuals decided to undertake the program.

        </p>
        <p>

            Frank strong volunteered to help file the articles of incorporation that were signed by Inez Bowman as vice
            president, Bob Bush as president and Donna Holt as treasurer. On May 11, 1984, the Health Emergency Lifeline
            Program (HELP) became a not-for-profit corporation. A federal tax number was issued to the new organization
            on
            October 18, 1984. The all-volunteer organization known as, the Health Emergency Lifeline Program, Inc. was
            born.

        </p>

    </div>

    <div class="parallax background-image2"></div>

    <div class="history">

        <p>
            The first contract with Lifeline Systems, Inc., whose home office is in Massachusetts, was signed on June
            29, 1984. The units and new response center were shipped, and the first installation was set up for
            Wednesday, August 22, 1984 at 11:00 a.m. for Florence Zimmerman. It was quite a media event KQTV out of St.
            Joseph, MO and local media attending.
        </p>
        <p>

            Funding to start the program came from two large donations. The St. Francis Hospital Auxiliary donated
            $5,000 and the Business and Professional Women (BPW) donated $5,000 that had come to them from a bequest.
            Officers of HELP decided to lease the equipment rather than purchase it outright. This turns out to have
            been a wise decision. HELP would not have been able to expand the program if the home units and response
            center had to be purchased. At the time, individual units cost $495 and the response center $7,000.

        </p>
        <p>

            Leasing has allowed HELP to stay current with the latest technology. The life of each lease is five years.
            When the time period for each lease is ended, HELPâ€™s Executive Committee seeks approval from its Board of
            Directors to enter a new lease for the same number, a lesser number or a greater number of units. That
            decision is driven by whether there are several names on the waiting list. With over 150 units in service in
            2008, the program continues to be a valuable resource for Nodaway county community members and those living
            in the surrounding area whose doctors utilize St. Francis Hospital and Health Services. In the summer of
            2004, the volunteers who operate the program were happy to celebrate 20 years of dedicated service and
            caring for their neighbors through the Health Emergency Lifeline Program.

        </p>

    </div>
    <div class="parallax background-image3"></div>

    <div class="history">

        <p>
            In 2011 a transition from site monitoring at St. Francis Hospital to central monitoring from a location in
            Massachusetts was successfully completed. This change occurred because the site monitoring unit at St.
            Francis would become obsolete in 2012-- no longer able to be serviced. Site monitoring was free; central
            monitoring carries a monthly charge for each unit monitored. HELP has converted all program units from
            leased to owned property over the past 5 years with the return of the final leased units to Lifeline in
            February 2015. The commitment to ownership allows HELP to keep costs as affordable as possible to our
            Nodaway County subscribers.
        </p>
        <p>

            HELP current inventory has declined due to the discontinuance of the first digital units (DT 1000) and
            rollovers, we currently have an inventory of 88 units which includes the addition of cellular based units.
            HELP still has some DT 1000s in use and are gradually replacing them as they fail to work. Future purchases
            will include both landline (6900 Model Units) and cellular (7000 Series Units) communicators. In addition,
            there are units now being used that are mobile and do not use a base communicator. Communication is all
            through the button.

        </p>
        <p>

            Since 1984, HELP has served 1,155 subscribers as of 2019. Of the current subscribers, 78 have had Lifeline
            between one to ten years; 6 have had Lifeline over ten years of which 2 subscribers have received services
            for more than 15 years. Remaining in the security and comfort of their own home has been a reality for these
            valued members of our community.
